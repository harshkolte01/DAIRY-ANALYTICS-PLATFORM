WHY IS THIS PAGE HERE?
-------------------------
This page represents the "AI brain" of your dairy platform! It's where cutting-edge
artificial intelligence and machine learning work together to provide insights that
humans could never discover on their own. Think of it as having a team of data
scientists working 24/7 to find patterns, predict problems, and suggest improvements
for your dairy business.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?
--------------------
The main purpose is to:
1. **Intelligent Predictions** - Use AI to predict future demand patterns
2. **Spike Detection** - Automatically identify unusual demand spikes before they happen
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Find hidden patterns in your business data
4. **Automated Insights** - Generate business recommendations using AI
5. **Precision Forecasting** - Multiple AI models working together for accurate predictions
6. **Smart Analytics** - Understanding complex relationships in your data

WHY WE ARE DOING THIS?
----------------------
Traditional analysis has limitations that AI can overcome:

**Limitations of Traditional Methods:**
‚ùå Humans can only see obvious patterns
‚ùå Simple statistics miss complex relationships
‚ùå Manual analysis is slow and error-prone
‚ùå Cannot handle large amounts of data
‚ùå Reactive (only see problems after they happen)
‚ùå Limited ability to predict rare events

**Problems Without AI/ML:**
- Miss early warning signs of demand changes
- Cannot predict complex seasonal patterns
- Waste time on manual analysis
- React to problems instead of preventing them
- Less competitive than AI-powered competitors

**Benefits With Advanced ML:**
‚úÖ Predict problems before they happen
‚úÖ Discover hidden patterns automatically
‚úÖ Make accurate predictions about future
‚úÖ Get actionable business recommendations
