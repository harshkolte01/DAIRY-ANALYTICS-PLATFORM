ü§ñ MACHINE LEARNING MODELS - COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

WHY DO WE HAVE THESE MODELS?
----------------------------
These are trained artificial intelligence models that have "learned" from historical
data to make predictions about future dairy demand. Think of them as experienced
experts who have studied years of sales data and can now predict what will happen
next. The models are saved as files so they can be quickly loaded and used without
retraining.

WHAT MODELS DO WE HAVE?
-----------------------
Our models folder contains 2 files containing 5 specialized AI models:

üìÅ **File 1: latest_trained_models.pkl (15.9 MB)**
üìÅ **File 2: ml_models_20250803_110238_full.pkl (15.9 MB)**

Both files contain the same models but with timestamps for version control.
