üè† HOME PAGE: DEMAND FORECASTING
================================================================================

WHY IS THIS PAGE HERE?
-------------------------
This is the main landing page of our Dairy Analytics Platform. It's like the 
"control center" where you can see what's happening with milk demand and predict
what will happen in the future. Every dairy business needs to know how much milk
customers will want so they can plan their production properly.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?
--------------------
The main purpose is to:
1. Show historical demand patterns - "What happened in the past?"
2. Predict future demand - "What will happen next?"
3. Identify unusual patterns - "Is something different happening?"
4. Help plan production - "How much milk should we produce?"

WHY WE ARE DOING THIS?
----------------------
Imagine you run a dairy farm. You need to know:
- How much milk will customers buy next week?
- Are there seasonal patterns (like more milk sold during school months)?
- Will there be sudden spikes in demand during holidays?
- How much raw milk should you process?

Without this information, you might:
‚ùå Produce too much milk ‚Üí Waste and losses
‚ùå Produce too little milk ‚Üí Lost sales and unhappy customers
‚ùå Miss seasonal trends ‚Üí Poor planning

With demand forecasting, you can:
‚úÖ Plan production accurately
‚úÖ Reduce waste
‚úÖ Increase profits
‚úÖ Keep customers happy

HOW WE ARE DOING THIS?
----------------------
We use three powerful methods:

1. **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**
   - Look at past sales data (30,490 records from real dairy sales)
   - Calculate averages, trends, and patterns
   - Identify seasonal effects (summer vs winter demand)

2. **PROPHET FORECASTING MODEL**
   - Advanced Facebook Prophet algorithm
   - Automatically finds yearly, monthly, and weekly patterns
   - Accounts for holidays and special events
   - Creates confidence intervals (best case, worst case scenarios)

3. **VISUAL CHARTS**
   - Easy-to-read graphs showing past and future demand
   - Color-coded patterns for easy understanding
   - Interactive charts you can zoom and explore

HOW WILL IT HELP?

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
-------------------
Let's say it's Monday, and you want to plan for next week:

1. **Historical View**: See that last Tuesday had 15% higher sales than normal
2. **Seasonal Pattern**: Notice that this month typically has 20% higher demand
3. **Event Impact**: See that next Friday is a holiday, expect 30% spike
4. **Forecast**: System predicts you'll need 1,200 liters on Friday vs normal 900

Result: You plan production accordingly and avoid running out of stock!
